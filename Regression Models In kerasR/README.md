# Predicting City-Cycle Fuel Consumption Using Vehicle Attributes


## Business Problem : 
How can we accurately predict a vehicleâ€™s fuel consumption (in miles per gallon) based on its characteristics?
Efficient fuel consumption prediction helps automotive manufacturers, environmental agencies, and consumers make informed decisions to improve fuel economy, reduce emissions, and lower costs.

## Data:

The dataset is sourced from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository and was introduced in Quinlan (1993).
It contains:

Target variable: City-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon (mpg)
