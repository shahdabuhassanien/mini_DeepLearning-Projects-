This repository contains three Deep Learning mini-projects. Each project focuses on a different type of supervised learning task using neural networks:

## ðŸ”¹ Projects Overview

| Project | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [Regression Model](./Regression Models In kerasR/README.md) | Regression | Predicts continuous values (e.g., fuel consumption in MPG) using a neural network. |
| [Binary Classification](./Binary-Classification-Project/README.md) | Binary Classification | Classifies data into two categories (e.g., predicting yes/no outcomes). |
| [Multiclass Classification](./Multiclass-Classification-Project/README.md) | Multiclass Classification | Classifies data into more than two categories (e.g., digits 0â€“9, types of animals). |
